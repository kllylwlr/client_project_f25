            <h2>Build a Strategic Networking Plan</h2>
            <h3>Building a List for Strategic Networking </h3>
            <p>Identify a list of target organizations for strategic networking before you start to apply for jobs or interviews.</p>
            <p>The LAMP list can help you organize this information. It should have 5 columns. One to list your 40 target companies, one for alumni from said companies, one detailing your motivation, and one for postings at that company.</p>
            <p>An example spreadsheet can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/0/d/1axI0TA4-3FYtlyjkGu4rm_XbL8EOO2KQvd2t_bbdtAQ/edit">here</a></p>

            <h2>Outreach Messages</h2>
            <p>Your next step should be to reach out to peers, alumni, and professionals.</p>
            <p>Steve Dalton’s <i>The 2-Hour Job Search</i> promotes a 5-point email as an effective message for networking.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Keep it short! Try to keep it to 100 words or less</li>
                <li>No mention of jobs/internships in subject or body</li>
                <li>Connection goes first (e.g. UMSI connection)</li>
                <li>Generalize your interest - make it easy for them to respond</li>
                <li>Maintain the control of the follow up. This gives you permission to follow up once</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Find more details about this process and email examples in our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cwq2KtdKQbO-tICHKUyKRA3QY4_3VJ8NLC2kwPBY4dI/edit?usp=sharing">Networking Outreach Email Examples document</a></p>

            <h2>Planning an Informal Interview</h2>
            <p>After reaching out to people of interest in your field it’s time to build a connect with them!</p>
            <p>Informational interviews are a great way to gain information about companies, gain career advice, and strengthen the relationships in your network!</p>
            <p>One way you can go about doing this is the TIARA method outlined in our <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QR0UA8V4d_hjHuayVbzF5_bx8d_8m3Ohvx9e5SiBodg/edit?usp=sharing">Informational Interviews Using TIARA Slides</a></p>

            <h2>Career Fair Preparation</h2>
            <p>Your next step should be to attend a career fair and talk to potential employers!</p>
            <p>But before you go it’s best to prepare so you can make the most of the opportunity.</p>
            <p>Some things to prepare:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>A professional outfit</b> - Your aim at a career fair is to make a good first impression on employers, and attire is an essential aspect of that. Professional attire such as suit jackets, blazers, and dress shoes are great choices for a formal look.</li>
                <li><b>An elevator pitch</b> - An elevator pitch should be a quick 1 minute speech detailing your experience. It helps you make a strong first impression and communicates value you'd bring to the company</li>
                <li><b>Resume copies for potential employers</b> - Have copies of your resume to hand out to potential employers so they can follow up with you.</li>
            </ul>
